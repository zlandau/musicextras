Core
    - Add timeouts to greylist to auto-delete entries after X days? Ask
      nonexistent userbase for their opinion
GUI
    - Threading in musicextras would be nice. There were problems with it, so
      I took it out, but I would like to give it another shot.
    - Fix incremental searching (allow spaces, etc)  
    - Add configuration screen? I'm not convinced I want this yet.
Plugins
    - Add support for album year and whatnot? Dunno.
    - Plugins should catch exceptions so other plugins can still run
    - Detect when connection is down and don't add things to greylist
