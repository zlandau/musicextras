* guicontrol.rb  - Songs still get out of sync sometimes. It has to do with disconnecting extra clients.
* gtkgui.rb      - Replace image before calling .show on it.
* plyrics.rb     - Seems to get 'uninitialized constant Net::HTTP' every now and then
* all plugins    - Sometimes plugins seem to randomly quit out (turn exceptions on to check this)
